# Giftastic

This web app uses ajax to get a response from the Giphy API using user-input. The intial page is already populated with a few topics that are already set into an array, which is then for-looped over to create buttons with each topic. When a topic is clicked the page then displays the top 10 gifs related to said topic. The user is also able to add a button to the page with whatever topic they desire. Their input is pushed into the topics array, and is appended to the rest of the buttons.
